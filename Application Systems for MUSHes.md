## Application Systems for MUSHes should...
* ... be on-MUSH, to avoid having to add any additional work for staff to perform between two mediums, to avoid staff burnout.
* ... show clear application requirements, and a way to quickly visualize what is or is not done yet (Ex: `+app/checklist`, `+app/checklist <Player>`)
* ... have a guided experience through the requirements, so that players have an easy time to go from start to finish.
* ... require either player-object creation at login, or have a command as a guest-player to request a player-object, to streamline the process.
* ... have a clear visualization of what is Public and what is Private (player and staff visible) Character information.
* ... integrate directly with any [[Coded Combat Systems for MUSHes|Coded Combat System]], *if applicable*, so that a player is ready to go out of the gate.
* ... be able to track reviews in a *Job System with Permanent Storage*, so that any notes on the character are tracked administratively and can always be recalled at a later time. 
* ... focus on a singular player object.
* ... not be silent on approval. It should make sure everyone is aware of the approval as soon as possible, to celebrate it and integrate characters into the story of the MUSH.
* ... get the quickest turnaround possible. Player investment in their characters has a large chance to have a quick falloff if left too long to sit. While a 1-2 day approval is not required, the person applying should at least see a staffer being assigned to their character application as soon as possible, and any delays should be communicated at their earliest convenience in a place the applying player can see.
* ... put new players at the front of the line for applications. New players are the lifeblood of a MUSH, where-as existing players have other characters they can participate with.
