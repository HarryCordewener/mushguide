## Who is this for?
This is for anyone looking to create a MUSH and wants a checklist and some insights from someone who has run multiple MUSHes (and faced burnout due to a lack of foresight and other issues).
## Experience
* Mercutio @ `M*U*S*H` - Code Nerd
* Mercutio @ Angelic Layer MUSH - Code Wizard 
* Oathkeeper @ Final Kingdom - Head Wizard
* Liminality @ Elder Tale Online - Head Wizard
## Where should I start?
I recommend starting at the [[Admin Guidelines]] file, and going from there.
