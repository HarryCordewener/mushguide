Due to the medium of a MUSH, it is important to set very clear communication guidelines.
## Admin Communication
Make sure there is an open forum for Admin Discussion and ensure admin have a say in the direction of the game, but also set healthy boundaries for where certain roles get a last say. 
## Player Communication
Players are, in general, invested in the MUSH and the story - with a focus generally going to their own characters and the most important connections those characters have. This investment however also means that they are **sensitive about things that affect them and their friends**. Changes, and a lack of easily accessible information can create anxiety in your players.  This can be alleviated and managed by a variety of tactics - some admin teams taking different stances on how to best manage their game than others. As such, it is hard to say there is 'one true best way' to manage player communication. The following items are only recommendations, but the most important consideration is always to listen and internalize what is being said, before acting.
### Recommendations
#### Understand that they are Invested
* It is important to understand that players are invested in the game, from the perspective of a player. Though the customer is not always right, it can be important to ensure an admin's mindset at least considers this stance when communicating with players. Some stress can be avoided simply by taking a moment to put yourself in a player's shoes. Often, they're not trying to 'attack the admin' or 'attack the game' at their core, even if they are frustrated with the administration or communicating brashly, but are looking for a change that would better things for all.
* When players complain or speak out on channels, it can be easy to get overwhelmed or knee-jerk against complaints. Especially when other players join in. Give them an outlet by creating a future meeting to hear them out, and invite them to write out what they like to convey, and encourage them to give the full flow of reasoning in their criticism. This ensures they feel heard, but also gives them a moment to calm down and lower the chaos element. It is possible nothing useful comes out of it, but they may also have informative viewpoints that the admin don't see from their vantage points.
* It is important to understand that you are likely to have more information than the players, and they can't read your mind. See below for more under 'Provide Adequate Information'. So sometimes, just giving extra information can be enough.
* During Confrontation, consider the psychology of argument de-escalation methods.
	* **Validate their feelings:** Acknowledge and understand their emotions, even if you don't agree with their perspective.
		* 'I understand you a frustrated with our change to X item, especially as you are particularly affected by this'
	* **Use neutral language:** Avoid using insulting or accusatory language (and request them to do the same).
		* 'Let's take a moment to calm down. I understand you a frustrated, but we can come to a better solution together if we remain calm.'
	- **Ask clarifying questions:** Seek to understand the other person's perspective and ensure you're on the same page.
		- 'I understand you are frustrated with your constant losses. Let's get together privately and discuss what you feel are the main sources of this, and we can develop a plan'.
	- **Offer solutions:** Work together to find solutions that address both parties' needs.
		- 'We had to lock down applications for this Cast of Characters, but I understand you were really looking forward to play with this group. Let's see if we can do something about this to accomplish both of our goals.'
#### Set Healthy Boundaries
* It's good to have an On-Duty and Off-Duty tag. As long as admin maintain it. Players should not approach Off-Duty admin unless it's critical.
* Players should not message non-admin characters about admin subjects.
* Set guidelines for your channels: The world is often in turmoil, and players may wish for an outlet. Consider whether or not you wish for your MUSH to be such an outlet, as it is likely to affect the stress of your admin and other players - who may remain silent on the matter.
#### Set Expectations
* Set expected response dates on things such as application-turnarounds. 
* Set the feel of your game and theme, and how you expect people to interact with each other.
	* Example: 'Don't yuck in peoples' yum'.
* Set clear expectations of what will happen when players do not abide to the Boundaries your game has set.
#### Provide Adequate Information
* A lot of stress can be avoided by providing information on sources such as a wiki. And enabling players to edit your wikis can be a good way to ensure that new information gets documented by them. 
* Important Information:
	* Theme Information, a Timeline of events
	* A rolling summary of important MUSH events. This can be difficult to maintain, but a monthly or quarterly review of the most influential happenings of your game can be important to helping new or returning players integrate to your game.
	* Command Help Files, **With Examples**
	* Provide Application Examples, which also plays into **Set Expectations**.
#### Ensure there is a Community
* Players tend to aggregate in the OOC Nexus and on channels because a MUSH is community-driven. This is healthy, and should be encouraged. 
* Cliques will naturally form between players who enjoy playing with each-other. This is not necessarily a negative, but can make other players feel left out. Your plot-staffer creating public events is critical in helping get together.
* Ensure there's a way for players to publicly indicate availability for RP, such as a `+rp/looking` command and its status being reflected in +who. This can help open up people finding scenes to play within.
* Adding external community sources, such as Discord, can create a divide in player-interactivity between that and things like a channel. Consider integrating any external channels such as Discord with the MUSH if viable.
* Be Available: Instead of sitting quietly in a Staff Nexus, hang out with the players in the OOC Nexus with them. Just being there can help players feel they are being listened to, but more importantly, like you are not detached from the player-base. 
#### Be Transparent with Reasoning
* When making changes (Example: Balance in a Combat System, Changing Application Requirements, etc.), it is important to be transparent with the reason why these approaches were taken. Sweeping generalizations are not as effective as fact-driven communication.
	* Don't: `Some players have complained about Evasion being too powerful, so we have lowered all evasion stats.`
	* Do: `We have seen a 30% win-ratio advantage for builds which favor Evasion versus Guard, with all other things being equal, and have made the following changes: We have re-balanced the Evasion function to reduce the effect of Evasion by ~5%`
* When planning to make a change due to player inquiry, make sure to communicate with the player that you are investigating the matter. 
#### Get all Sides 
* It is easy to fall into the trap of getting a report from one side and react to it. Make sure to gather information from multiple sides when there is a discussion or issue.
