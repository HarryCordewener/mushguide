## What is Burnout
Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress. It's characterized by feelings of exhaustion, detachment from work or other activities, and reduced personal accomplishment.
## Relevance
MUSHes are nothing without their players. But administrative work and plot-running is often also quite important. And when staff stops running plots, stops approving, or otherwise becomes detached, it can be a major problem for a MUSH.

### MUSH as a Job
It's common for the MUSH to start feeling like a job. This is normal, as any administrative work on a MUSH means not being able to play, or enjoy other parts of their lives. MUSHing is a hobby, and should feel as little like a job as possible.
### Player Complaints
Player complaints can directly affect the feelings of admin. And while player complaints generally means a heavy investment into a MUSH, and their enjoyment there-of, it can be detrimental to staff (and players) when there are too many complaints.
### No Time To Play
Admins having too much work on their plate, or players bugging them for admin-related things when they're trying to get roleplaying, can get problematic. This is especially critical for Plot Staff.
