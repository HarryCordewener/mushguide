## Coded Combat for a MUSH should...
* ... be anywhere between 5 and 7 rounds.
* ... should have obvious victory conditions (Ex: HP, HP or Morale, et cetera).
* ... consider the idea of what a 'round' is, due to combat being free-flowing.
* ... ensure the player feels they have agency
* ... ensure that the gap between a new player and an existing player does not feel insurmountable.
* ... allow for a boost for someone being challenged by multiple players, when it does not focus only on 1v1 battles.
* ... allow a player to set their own combat stats, so that staff only needs to approve, or request adjustments, to avoid staff burnout.
* ... make it painless for staff to do administrative tasks, to avoid staff burnout.
* ... store a combat session's status, so that it can be continued without anyone being bound to not pursue other events in between.
* ... give an easy oversight of combat events.
* ... give an easy oversight of combat members and their most recent target(s).
* ... consider how to handle a player having to leave mid-combat, so that a partner isn't left out of the event.
* ... have a way to test combat in a quick and easy way, in case of balance inquiries. *Ceteris Paribus* (All other things being Equal) is an important concept in combat system balance design.
* ... have a way to track wins and losses of players, and their dates. Not for the sake of the player, but for a quick reference point for admin, in the case of balance inquiries. The dates are important so that items in a balance-change date range can be considered.
* ... document any and all balance changes, and their dates.
* ... understand that a perfectly balanced system isn't interesting, and also practically impossible to produce.
