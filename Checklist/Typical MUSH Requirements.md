To create a successful MUSH, typically there's a series of requirements to meet, commands and organization wise.
# Have a Website
It is typical these days to have a website for your MUSH these days, to help advertise and introduce the MUSH to your (potential) players. It should list the connection address front and center on the main landing.
## Source of Information
A MUSH website tends to be the main source of Information about your MUSH. And it's quite normal to use a Wiki, such as MediaWiki or WikiJS. 
## Minimum Information
### How to Connect
Where to connect, and how? What clients do you recommend?
### Theme Documentation
What is your MUSH about? What does your MUSH 'feel' like? What kind of roleplay can people look forward to? Give them a quick and easy to understand summary of your MUSH as a whole.
### Setting Documentation
What is the Setting of your MUSH? Is it modern day? Is it in the lands of Tolkien? Give an idea of the world people will play in, common day phrases, cities, its timeline and history, etc. The more your players can drill into, the better (to a point).
### Rules
Player Expectations, Policies? Be excellent to each-other!
### Application
How do players apply to your game? Give them visual and easy to understand step by steps, and examples! See [[Application Systems for MUSHes]].
### Signs of Roleplay
Either use a Scene System or give players a way to put their roleplay on your website in some other way. Ensure that new players have a way to browse historical events, and quickly see that scenes are still happening!
## Nice To Have
### Combat System
Have a Combat System, or other Resolution System? Nice, give them a tutorial and visual instructions! 
It's good to have its commands available on your game by means of `+help`, but a combat system can be an attractor, so make sure to give good insights here.

# Have A Plan
## Plot Plan
### Short Term Plans
> Coming soon
### Long Term Vision
> Coming soon
## Launch Plan
### Advertise!
* Have an advertisement ready and spread it to multiple games. 
* Make sure to list your game ahead of time on places like Mudstats.com. 
### Prepare your Guest Objects
* Make sure you have Guest Objects ready to receive new players when you open your doors. 
### Announce ahead of Time
* Announce a few months ahead of time, and again, advertise!
### Have your Staff Ready
* Make sure everyone is ready to go.
### When to Open?
* Around April to July appears to be a good time to open a MUSH, based on learnings.
* Avoid times with a lot of intensive holidays. As such, avoid November, December, January.
* It can be good to have the opportunity for people to log into your Game or Community Discord as Guests a few days before opening, to build hype.
